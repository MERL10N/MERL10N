## What I am currently working on

- Lightning Engine: A custom game engine that I am working on that is written in C++, and uses Metal as the rendering backend via metal-cpp libary. This project serves as a testbed for me to learn, experiment, and implement low-level game development techniques with the long-term goal of exploring the potential of Apple Silicon hardware for games.
  

- Project Shadow: A sonic fangame developed in Unreal Engine 5 as part of the quarter project under Gamespawn@UCR
